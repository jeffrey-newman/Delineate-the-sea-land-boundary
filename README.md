# Delineate-the-sea-land-boundary
Given a raster that 1 for water and 0 for land), this code will create a raster where  0 - land, 1 - water, 2 - land-water boundary, where the value of 2 is given to cells that are on a land pixel, but have a neighbouring water pixel (8-direction)
Code developed under funds from the Bushfire and Natural Hazards CRC
